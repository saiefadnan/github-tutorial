Phase 4: Recovery & History Cleanup
Accidentally commit changes to the wrong branch → move those changes to the correct branch.

Amend the very last commit (add forgotten change + fix message).

Undo the last commit but keep the changes in working directory/staged area.

Completely undo and discard the last commit + changes.

Create a branch with 5 small, related commits → use interactive rebase to squash them into 2–3 cleaner commits.

Pick one specific commit from another branch and apply it to your current branch.

Reset your branch to an earlier commit (keep changes in working directory).

Reset your branch to an earlier commit and discard all later changes completely.
