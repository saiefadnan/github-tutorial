# Phase-04

## 1. Accidentally commit changes to the wrong branch → move those changes to the correct branch.

## 2. Amend the very last commit (add forgotten change + fix message).

## 3. Undo the last commit but keep the changes in working directory/staged area.

## 4. Completely undo and discard the last commit + changes.

## 5. Create a branch with 5 small, related commits → use interactive rebase to squash them into 2–3 cleaner commits.

## 6. Pick one specific commit from another branch and apply it to your current branch.

## 7. Reset your branch to an earlier commit (keep changes in working directory).

## 8. Reset your branch to an earlier commit and discard all later changes completely
