# Phase-05

## 1. Simulate team flow: create two feature branches, make changes on each.

## 2. As "team lead": merge both features into main via command line (two separate merges).

## 3. As "developer": after leader merged, update your local branch and push new work.

## 4. Create a pull request from one feature branch to main on GitHub → merge it through the web interface.

## 5. Resolve a small conflict directly in the GitHub pull request interface.

## 6. Simulate a disaster: commit junk to main → recover using reset techniques.

## 7. Full end-to-end challenge: Start fresh day → sync → work on feature → get "team" update on main → resolve conflict → clean history → create PR → merge.

#Final Challenge (Capstone)

## 8. Time yourself doing a complete realistic cycle (sync → 3 commits → conflict → resolve → rebase clean → PR) — aim to get under 10 minutes with confidence.
