# Phase-02
## 1. Create a new feature branch from main.

## 2. Rename your current branch to something more descriptive.

## 3. Delete an old, merged branch (not the current one).

## 4. Simulate a full daily start: update main from remote, switch to your feature branch, update your branch with latest main.

## 5. Make 2–3 commits on your feature branch.

## 6. Intentionally work on an outdated branch (skip update step), try to push → observe failure.

## 7. Fix the outdated branch so you can successfully push (use force if needed).

## 8. Repeat the full sync → work → update → push cycle 3 times in a row
